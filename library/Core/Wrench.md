The BuildCraft Wrench is your base tool for interacting with BuildCraft and many other mods.

It can be used to:

* Change the orientation of in-game blocks (chests, furnaces, stairs, etc.)
* Change pipe input direction or parameters (iron power pipe limit, lapis/daizuli pipe color, etc.)
* Fix overheated engines
* Pick up Robots from Docking Station or the ground
* Rotate chests, furnaces, stairs, or any other rotatable blocks

To use the Wrench, simply right-click like you would with any other tool. Some actions might require a shift-right-click.
