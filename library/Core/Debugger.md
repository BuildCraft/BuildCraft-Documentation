The Debugger is a creative-only item meant for BuildCraft development. Right-clicking a certain block with it will give you debug information about the block, which is very useful for figuring out 
bugs. The BuildCraft Development Team recommend that you do not use it unless necessary, for doing otherwise probably means that something is not intuitive enough in the mod by itself.
