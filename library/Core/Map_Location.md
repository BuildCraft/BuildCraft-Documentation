The Map Location is an item used to store locations, primarily used by the [Robots](/Robotics/Robot.md).

There are multiple ways to store a location:

* Right-click the map location on any block ("spot" location)
* Right-click the map location on an area marked by Land Marks ("box" location)
* Right-click the map location on a set of connected Path Markers ("path" location)
* Put the map location into a [Zone Planner](/Robotics/Zone_Planner.md) ("zone" location)
