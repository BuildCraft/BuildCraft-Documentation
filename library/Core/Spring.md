Springs are blocks which look similar to bedrock and can only be found in natural worldgen. They will generate a block of liquid above them every five minutes.

There are two types of Springs in BuildCraft:

* Water Spring, included with Core - especially useful if finite water is enabled,
* Oil Spring, included with Energy.
