The Land Mark allows you to mark areas in the world. This is used by the Builders module, as well as [Map Locations](/Core/Map_Location.md).

The Land Mark can be placed on any side of a block. When right-clicked, a Land Mark will look in all directions to find another Land Mark up to 64 blocks away. If one is found, the two will be linked and shown as a red laser.

Connecting the two marks to another one on another axis will define a square.

If linked to a fourth one on a third axis, they combined will define a cube.

If one of the linked Land Marks is dropped or removed, the entire selection will be cancelled.

In order to use the defined area, the machine has to touch the red laser on the outside of the selection. If the machine is placed correctly, the markers will be dropped and the red laser replaced with stripes.

If you send a non-linked Land Mark a redstone signal, it will emit a blue laser for 64 blocks in all directions. This is an aid for lining up the other land marks, which is often hard on large distances.
