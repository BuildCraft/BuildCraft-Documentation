The Redstone Engine is an engine which operates with just a Redstone Signal. However, due to the very low amounts of energy redstone power can provide, it will not power typical machines at all! It 
won't connect to Kinesis Pipes either. The primary uses of a Redstone Engine are to power Pipes, the Pump and speed up the Auto Workbench.

The Redstone Engine cannot explode or overheat (as of 7.0.x).
