**WARNING:** This documentation is still a work in progress! Not everything is documented yet.

BuildCraft is a Minecraft mod that aims at providing advanced building and engineering capabilities to gameplay.

The mod consists of several modules which offer differing functionality:

* Core - (Dependency for all other modules; wrench, redstone engine, list, map location)
* Builders - (Builder, Filler, Quarry, etc.)
* Energy - (Power generation, stirling and combustion engines)
* Factory - (Auto Workbench, flood gate, mining well, pump, tank, ... - low-tech automation)
* Silicon - (Lasers and other laser tables - also required for Gates)
* Transport - (Pipes, lenses, filters, facades, and filtered buffer)
* Robotics - (Robots! - Requires Silicon and Transport to work)

There is also an official addon available called BuildCraft Compat which tries to ensure compatibility between BuildCraft and other mods - builder integration, special features, et cetera.
