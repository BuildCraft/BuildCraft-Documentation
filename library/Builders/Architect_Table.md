The Architect Table lets you record buildings onto a [Blueprint](/Builders/Blueprint.md) or [Template](/Builders/Template.md). To give it an area, you place the table next to an area defined by [Land Marks](/Core/Land_Mark.md):

The recording time differs depending on the size and complexity of the area being recorded.

Note: You cannot change the options while recording a template.

* Rotate - if on, the structure will be rotated when building depending on the Builder's orientation.
* Excavate - if on, the air blocks within the building area will be removed when trying to build this Blueprint.
* Mode - there are two modes of Blueprint recording:
    * Survival - Only blocks which are supported by the Architect Table/Builder will be recorded. Most simple blocks are supported automatically, as well as BuildCraft's own and many mod blocks thanks to BuildCraft Compat. This lets you build the Blueprint in survival mode, and has to be done this way due to the possibility of item duplication bugs.
    * Creative - All blocks will be recorded on the Blueprint - however, if any unsupported blocks are detected, the Blueprint will only work in Creative Mode.
* Name - Every Blueprint and Template can be named.
