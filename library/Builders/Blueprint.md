Blueprints are used to copy in-world structures (with an [Architect Table](/Builders/Architect_Table.md)), which can then later be used in other machines. Unlike Templates, they save the exact contents of a structure.

## Notes

* The recording is not 100% precise. Most of the time, it will be the same thing as the actual world contents (e.g. rotation), but sometimes certain generalizations will be made. For example, growing 
seeds will always be stored as their first growing stage, no matter what they were in the original build.
