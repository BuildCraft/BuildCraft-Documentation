Filler is a machine for filling areas (marked with [Land Marks](/Core/Land_Mark.md)) with blocks.

### The GUI

![Filler GUI](/images/screenshots/fillergui.png)

* [1] Mode - you can set this to a variety of different modes.
* [2] Parameters - certain modes have special parameters which influence the shape built.
* [3] "Excavate" button - can be set to "Excavate" (remove all blocks which are not part of the shape) or "Do Not Excavate" (keep blocks not part of the shape as-is).
* [4] Filling Resources - this is where the Filler gets blocks to build from.

### Filler Modes

* **Clear** - destroys all blocks in the area
* **Box** - fills all six sides of the area with blocks - like a hollow cube
* **Frame** - creates a frame outline out of blocks in the area
* **Cylinder** - creates a cylinder, hollow or filled.
