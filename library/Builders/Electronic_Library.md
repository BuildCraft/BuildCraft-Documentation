The Electronic Library allows players to save various items (for example, [Blueprints](/Builders/Blueprint.md), 
[Templates](/Builders/Template.md) and Books) to a local, client-side library (.minecraft/blueprints), as well as load them from 
there. This allows you to share content between worlds, servers and even over the Internet!

The list to the left contains various saved items - the colour shows the type (blueprints are blue, templates black, books brown).

* To save an item, you put it into the slot pointing to the list (top-right).
* To load an item, you put an item of the same type into the slot pointing away from the list (bottom-left).
* To delete an item, select the item from the list and press "Del".

Remember that the Library works between worlds, game modes, servers and even modpacks!
