**NOTE:** This item is only present if BuildCraft Robotics is installed.

The Construction Markers are markers which arrange [Blueprints](/Builders/Blueprint.md) and [Templates](/Builders/Template.md) in various places on the map, for use by the Builder robot. Setting them up is much more convienent and cheaper than using multiple Builders, however the robots build at a much slower rate.

When you place a Construction Marker in the world, it will show a protruding striped marker indication the direction the template will be built in.

To use the Construction Marker, put a Blueprint or Template inside it by performing a right-click. Once done, a striped box will appear indicating the construction area.

The Builder Robot will search for the nearest Construction Marker and build their schematics one step at a time. Remember that the Robot needs inventories somewhere in its loading area to supply the blocks and items necessary for construction. To speed up the process, you can use multiple Builder Robots in the same area simultaneously.
