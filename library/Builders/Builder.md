The Builder is a machine which builds the contents of a [Blueprint](/Builders/Blueprint.md) or [Template](/Builders/Template.md) into the world.

* [1] Schematic Slot - place a Blueprint or Template here.
* [2] Requirements - for Blueprints, this shows the blocks required to build the structure.
* [3] Resources - these are the items used to build.
* [4] Fluid Resources - if fluids are part of the structure, the Builder can use the fluid tanks contained inside to place them. To fill them, you can right-click with a bucket or use fluid piping.

To build a Blueprint in Survival Mode, the Builder requires the exact resources listed in the Requirements queue, as well as energy. In Creative Mode, only energy is required.

To build a Template, you can feed it arbitrary blocks - just like the [Filler](/Builders/Filler.md). As it cannot predict what blocks are necessary, it requires materials even in Creative Mode.

### Tips and tricks

* If you're using robots, the Builder provides a "Request Needed Items" action for Docking Stations. It will automatically request the items necessary to continue building, for instance for Delivery Robots.
