The Laser is used to power Laser Tables by turning RF energy into laser-transmitted power.

The Laser will look for laser tables in an 11x6x11 cube surrounding it:

One Laser can only emit up to 40 RF/t. The colour of the Lasers depends on the amount of RF energy it is transmitting:

Colour | Energy amount (RF/t)
------ | --------------------
Red | 0-10
Yellow | 10-20
Green | 20-30
Blue | 30-40

If multiple laser tables are found, energy will be emitted to the ones requesting power in random order.
