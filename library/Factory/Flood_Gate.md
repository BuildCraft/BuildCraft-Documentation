The Flood Gate is a machine which outputs fluids into the world. It is very useful in filling large areas with fluid.

The fluids have to be inserted to the top of the Flood Gate, and will be output from the bottom and sides up until the fluid is filled up to and including the height the machine is on.

An active redstone signal will stop the Flood Gate from placing fluids.
