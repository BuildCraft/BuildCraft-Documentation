The Auto Workbench allows you to automatically craft most recipes at a very cheap cost. The exception is recipes which contain a fluid container a the ingredient, such as buckets, cans or cells.

In order for the automatic crafting mechanism to be activated, first assign the recipe inside its crafting grid (the items will not be used), then put the necessary resources in its inventory slots.

The Auto Workbench does not require or accept any power, however [Redstone Engines](/Core/Redstone_Engine.md) can be used to speed up the process slightly.
