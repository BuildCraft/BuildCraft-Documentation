The Chute (up until Minecraft 1.4.7 known as the Hopper) is a block whose purpose is to buffer items and extend the storage capacity of machines. It has less features than the Minecraft Hopper, however 
it sends items faster, is cheaper and more server-efficient.

A special feature of the Chute is the ability to drop items directly into Transport Pipes. This is accomplished by supplying it with energy. A Redstone Engine is sufficient, however faster engines will 
cause it to send items down fater.
