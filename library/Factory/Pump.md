The Pump is a machine which extracts fluids from the world. It requires low amounts of energy and can thus be powered by a [Redstone Engine](/Core/Redstone_Engine.md). It is also able to automatically send a tube down to extract fluids directly below it.

The Pump auto-ejects extracted fluids to any adjacent fluid pipes or tiles which store fluids (for example a [Tank](/Factory/Tank.md), but also a [Combustion Engine](/Energy/Combustion_Engine.md).

### Tips

* The Pump, following Minecraft's mechanics, does not consume water when pumping it out.
