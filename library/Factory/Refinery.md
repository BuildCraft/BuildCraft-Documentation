The Refinery is a machine which refines fluids. Currently, its only purpose is to turn [Oil](/Energy/Oil.md) into [Fuel](/Energy/Fuel.md).

It has three internal tanks: two for input and one for output. Each tank can hold four buckets, which means that the Refinery can hold eight buckets of input and four or output.

You can use buckets or Fluid Pipes to insert and remove liquid from the Refinery.

The Refinery has two moving parts, indicating the speed of processing: the faster they move, the faster the processing is. They also change colour depending on the speed (red -> purple -> blue -> green).
