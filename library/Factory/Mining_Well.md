The Mining Well is an early-game mining device, much cheaper and less powerful than the [Quarry](/Builders/Quarry.md). The Mining Well can dig a 1x1 hole vertically to the ground underneath it until it encounters bedrock or lava.

During digging, it extends down Mining Pipes and mines blocks. The pipes will disappear once the Mining Well is removed.

The Mining Well will automatically eject mined objects into adjacent inventories, then pipes. Failing that, it will throw items into the air.
