Oil is a finite fluid which can later be refined into other materials, such as [Fuel](/Energy/Fuel.md). It can be used in a Combustion Engine, however Fuel proves much more resource-efficient.

* Do not swim in oil! It will drag you down.
* Oil explodes instantenously in the Nether.

It can be found spawning in deposits on almost every biome, as well as in its own Oil Fields which contain a large amount of "geysers" close to each other.

Size of Oil Deposit | Spawn Probability | Amount of units per deposit
------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------
Small | 3% (in desert) | Â±16 buckets
Medium | 0.2% (any biome) | 100 - 1000 buckets
Large | 0.005% (any biome) | 2000 - 17000 buckets

Some larger Oil Deposits can also contain an [Oil Spring](/Core/Spring.md), which will very slowly spawn blocks of oil.
